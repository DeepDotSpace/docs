You've got the basics. Here's where to go from here.

## Explore the Library

The best way to learn is by seeing what others have built. Browse the Pod Library, find pods that solve problems similar to yours, and study how they work.

## Build Something Small

Start with a simple pod:

- A personal tracker (habits, expenses, workouts)
- A calculator for something specific to your work
- A dashboard for data you check often

Small projects teach you the patterns without overwhelming complexity.

## Join the Community

Connect with other builders on Discord:

  Share what you're building, get feedback, request integrations, and see what others are working on.

## Request Features

Don't see an integration you need? Have an idea for the platform? The Discord is the place to suggest it. We prioritize based on what the community needs.

## Keep Learning

As you build more complex pods, you'll discover:

- How pods can communicate with each other
- Advanced patterns for data management
- Ways to compose multiple pods into systems

The agent can help you explore these as you encounter them. Just ask.
