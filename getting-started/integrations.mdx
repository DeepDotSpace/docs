DeepSpace comes with pre-wired integrations so your pods can connect to external services without painful setup. No API keys to manage, no authentication flows to build—just use them.

## Available Integrations

### AI & Language Models
- **Text Generation** - GPT-4o, Claude, and other LLMs for generating, summarizing, or transforming text
- **Image Generation** - Create images from text descriptions (multiple models available)
- **Video Generation** - Generate short video clips

### Search & Data
- **Web Search** - Search the web and get structured results
- **Image Search** - Find images across the web
- **Video Search** - Search for videos
- **Academic Search** - Search scholarly articles and papers
- **PDF Search** - Find PDF documents

### Calendar & Productivity
- **Google Calendar** - Read and create calendar events

### Image Processing

- **Image Upscaling** - Enhance image resolution
- **Style Transfer** - Apply artistic styles to images
- **Image Expansion** - Extend images beyond their borders
- **Relighting** - Adjust lighting in images

## Using Integrations in Pods

When you ask the agent to build a pod, just describe what you need:

- "Show my Google Calendar events for this week"
- "Create a pod that generates images from my text prompts"
- "Build a research tool that searches academic papers"

The agent knows what integrations are available and will wire them up automatically.

## How It Works

We build wrappers around external APIs so the agent doesn't need to memorize boilerplate code that gets used over and over. The authentication and API complexity is handled by DeepSpace—your pods just make simple requests and get data back.
