## Using Integrations in Pods

When you ask the agent to build a pod, just describe what you need:

- "Show my Google Calendar events for this week"
- "Create a pod that generates images from my text prompts"
- "Build a research tool that searches academic papers"
- "Track the latest F1 race results and standings"
- "Search for flights to Tokyo next month"
- "Show me trending Polymarket predictions"
- "Analyze this GitHub repo's recent activity"

The agent knows what integrations are available and will wire them up automatically.

## How It Works

We build wrappers around external APIs so the agent doesn't need to memorize boilerplate code that gets used over and over. The authentication and API complexity is handled by DeepSpace—your pods just make simple requests and get data back.
