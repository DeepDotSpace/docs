DeepSpace is built for sharing. Pods you build can be published for others to use, and you can collaborate with others in real-time.

## Publishing to the Library

When you've built something useful, publish it to the Pod Library:

1. Open your pod's settings
2. Click **Publish to Library**
3. Add a title, description, and select a category
4. Submit for review

Once approved, your pod appears in the library for anyone to discover and use.

## What Gets Shared

When you publish a pod:

- **Code and UI** - The pod's functionality and interface
- **Default configuration** - Initial settings and layout
- **Integration connections** - Which services the pod uses

What stays private:

- **Your data** - The data in your instance of the pod
- **Personal settings** - Your customizations and preferences

## Attribution

When someone edits your pod to create their own version, the original creator is credited. Each modified version can go in its own direction while maintaining connection to its origins.

## Collaborating in Real-Time

Share your desktop with others for live collaboration. Think Google Docs, but for entire app workspaces.

- **Share a link** - Invite collaborators by link or email
- **See presence** - See who's online and what they're working on
- **Edit together** - Changes sync instantly across all participants
- **View-only option** - Let others see your dashboard without editing

Unlike traditional document collaboration, you're not just editing text—you're building and using live applications together. Multiple people can interact with the same pods simultaneously, see each other's changes in real-time, and build on each other's work.

## Single Account, Everywhere

Your DeepSpace account works across:

- Web browser
- Mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Desktop app

Pods sync automatically. Build on your laptop, check from your phone.
