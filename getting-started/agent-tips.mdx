The agent is powerful, but how you communicate with it affects the results. Here's how to get the most out of it.

## Be Specific About What You Want

Vague requests lead to generic results. Specific requests get you closer to what you actually need.

| Instead of... | Try... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Make a tracker" | "Make a workout tracker where I log exercises with sets, reps, and weight" |
| "Build a dashboard" | "Build a sales dashboard showing monthly revenue, top products, and a trend chart" |
| "Create a form" | "Create a contact form with name, email, message, and a submit button that shows a confirmation" |

## Attach Images and Files

You can attach images or files (txt, pdf) to your messages. This is useful for:

- **Demonstrating UI**: Share a screenshot of a design you want to replicate
- **Highlighting errors**: Attach a screenshot showing what's wrong with the current implementation
- **Sharing documentation**: Include specs, requirements, or reference material for specific features

## Start Simple, Then Add Complexity

Don't try to describe everything upfront. Start with the core functionality, get that working, then layer on features.

1. "Create a todo list with add and delete"
2. "Add due dates to each item"
3. "Add priority levels: high, medium, low"
4. "Sort by priority, then by due date"

This iterative approach gives you checkpoints and makes debugging easier.

## Ask for Changes Clearly

When something isn't right, be specific about what needs to change:

- **Good**: "The save button should be blue instead of gray"
- **Good**: "Move the total to the bottom of the list"
- **Good**: "When I click submit, show a loading spinner"

- **Vague**: "Make it look better"
- **Vague**: "It's not working"

If something is broken, describe what you expected vs. what happened.

## Provide Examples When Helpful

If you have a specific vision, reference it:

- "Make it look like a Notion database"
- "I want the layout similar to Trello with columns"
- "Use a card-based design like this screenshot"

## Let the Agent Ask Questions

For complex requests, the agent may ask clarifying questions before building. This is good—it means you'll get something closer to what you want on the first try.

Answer the questions, and the agent will proceed with a clearer understanding of your needs.

## Common Pitfalls

**Changing direction mid-build**: If you realize you want something completely different, it's often cleaner to start fresh rather than heavily modifying.

**Skipping the details**: "Make it nice" means different things to different people. Be explicit about colors, sizes, layouts if they matter to you.
