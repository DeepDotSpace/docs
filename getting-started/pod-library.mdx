The Pod Library is where you discover what others have built. Instead of starting from scratch, you can browse, add, and customize existing pods.

## Browsing the Library

Open the Pod Library from your desktop to see available pods organized by category:

- **Productivity** - Task managers, note-taking, calendars
- **Entertainment** - Games, media, fun stuff
- **Travel** - Trip planning, itineraries, booking helpers
- **Sports** - Scores, trackers, fitness tools
- **Business** - CRM, invoicing, analytics
- **Lifestyle** - Habits, recipes, personal tools

Each pod shows a preview, description, and what integrations it uses.

## Adding Pods to Your Desktop

Found something useful? Click to add it to your desktop. The pod is instantly available—no installation, no setup, no account creation.

You can add multiple instances of the same pod if needed, each with its own data and configuration.

## Editing Pods

Want to customize a pod? Edit it to create your own version.

When you edit a pod:
- You get a complete copy you can modify
- The original stays unchanged
- Your changes are yours to keep or share

This is how software compounds in DeepSpace. Someone builds a basic task tracker. You edit it and add priority levels. Someone else edits yours and adds team assignments. Each version builds on the last.

## Finding the Right Pod

- **Search** by keyword or functionality
- **Filter** by category or integration
- **Sort** by popularity, recency, or relevance

Can't find what you need? That's where [building your own](/getting-started/building-pods) comes in.
