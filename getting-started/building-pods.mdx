When you can't find what you need in the library, build it yourself. Describe what you want in plain language, and the AI agent will create it for you.

## Talking to the Agent

Open the agent panel and describe what you want to build. Be conversational—you're talking to an AI that understands context.

**Example prompts:**

- "Create a habit tracker where I can check off daily habits and see my streaks"
- "Build a simple invoice generator with line items and a total"
- "Make a pod that shows my upcoming calendar events for the week"

The agent will think through what's needed, ask clarifying questions if something is ambiguous, and then build it.

For more on communicating effectively with the agent, see [Agent Tips](/getting-started/agent-tips).

## Watching the Agent Work

As the agent builds, you'll see its thinking process, how it's constructing the pod in code, and what tools it's using along the way.

This transparency is there for the curious—if you want to understand what's happening under the hood, you can follow along. If you'd rather just wait for the result, that's fine too. You can safely ignore the details.

## Iterating and Refining

Your first version doesn't have to be perfect. Once the agent finishes, try out the pod and then ask for changes:

- "Make the buttons bigger"
- "Add a dark mode toggle"
- "Store the data so it persists when I reload"
- "Connect this to my Google Calendar"

Each request refines the pod. The agent remembers the context of what you've built, so you can have a natural back-and-forth conversation.

## Starting from Existing Pods

You don't have to start from zero. Edit a pod from the library, then ask the agent to modify it:

- "Take this expense tracker and add categories"
- "Modify this dashboard to show weekly instead of daily data"
- "Add a search bar to this contact list"

Building on existing work is often faster than starting fresh.

## What Can Pods Do?

Pods in DeepSpace can:
- Store and display data
- Connect to external APIs and services
- Communicate with other pods
- Include interactive UI elements
- Process and transform data

See [Integrations](/getting-started/integrations) for the full list of services your pods can connect to.
