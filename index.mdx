## Your Desktop

The desktop is your workspace. Pods you add or build appear here, organized in a dock for easy navigation.

## Pods

Pods are mini-apps that live in DeepSpace—task trackers, dashboards, calculators, games, whatever you need. Think of them as building blocks you can combine, customize, and share.

You can:
- **Add** pods from the library
- **Build** new ones by describing what you want
- **Edit** existing pods to customize them
- **Share** your creations with others
